    "### What is a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects. The environment will have its own version of Python running (rather than the system-wide version). Any packages installed in this virtual environment will then be accessible in this virtual environment only, and likewise, the virtual environment will not have access to packages installed outside the environment. This allows us to keep projects clean with packages installed relevant to the project. Additionally and more importantly, we can avoid conflicting versions of packages being installed as we can have different versions of a package for each virtual environment without affecting one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also makes it easier to work together on a project. Just sending a python script may cause many library errors, as everyone's system-wide libraries look different. Using a virtual environment, we can share a state of the environment with others, who can then install the exact same versions of libraries in their own virtual environment."
