# Wine Quality Dashboard

This dashboard has been built in streamlit. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the capabilities of streamlit.

This dashboard provides options to:
- explore the wine quality dataset
- see how different models perform in predicting the wine quality
- endpoint to predict using each of the models

You can navigate through the different pages on the left side bar.

To run this locally, you pull this repo, and download the dataset separately here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Then navigate to the folder containing streamlit_tutorial.py and run:

```
streamlit run streamlit_tutorial.py
```
